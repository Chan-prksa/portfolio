    "This notebook is about an algorithm that can find the n-th regular number in linear time O(n). According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number#Number_theory), a regular number is formally defined as a number of the form $2^i \\cdot 3^j \\cdot 5^k$ where $i,j$ and $k$ are nonnegative integers. What make this problem interesting is that a similar problem was asked during Google interview, as reported in [this post on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5505894/tricky-google-interview-question/5506635).\n",

    "Below code will produce a sequence of regular number in ascending order. Starting from the first iteration, the algorithm takes O(1) to ouput `num=1` via `yield num` and O(1) for appending 1\\*2, 1\\*3, and 1\\*5 to the three FIFO queues `qs`. Likewise, in later iteration (in `while` loop), it takes O(1) to (1) retrieve the next regular number, (2) output `num` and (3) append `num*2, num*3, num*5` to `qs`. Because of this, the total runtime from iteration 1 to iteration n will be O(n). When we run through iteration 1 to iteration n, the algorithm will generate a sequence of the first, the second, and so on up to the n-th regular numbers.\n",

Near the end of the i-th iteration, the queue structure will be updated . This is done by adding `num*2` to the tail of the first sub queue, adding `num*3` the the tail of the second sub queue, and adding `num*5` to the tail of the third sub queue. \n",

So, at the beginning of the iteration i (i$\\geq$2), we can retrieve the i-th regular number from the queue structure.
